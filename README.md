# Randomized-Ship-Selector

Have you ever had no idea what ship to play?  
Do you want RNG before the match even starts?  
Did you want to pick a random ship by closing your eyes and clicking somewhere in the port but then you select something you dont want to play?  
Do you want an easy tool to select a random ship for you?  
Look no further!  
Randomized Ship Selector lets you customize the list from which you want to pick ships and randomly selects one!  

**How to open/install:**  
No installation required! 
- Download the .zip file here: [RandomizedShipSelector.zip](https://github.com/raptordmg/Randomized-Ship-Selector/releases/latest)  
- Unpack it (unzip) and run the executable file (.exe).  

Take note that there is a seperate .dll file in the zip file.  
That .dll needs to accompany the executable at all times otherwise the application will not work!

**How does it work I hear you asking:**  
I made a app which lets RNG decide what ship YOU need to play next.  
From v2.x the UI got updated with extra prefilters.  
On the right, fill in the screenname (accountname) of your account & server you play on.  
When you click on "search player" the program will prefilter the list of ships to all the ships that you have at least 1 battle in.  
Use the checkboxes on the left to further customize your random experience!  

Have Fun!

**Notice about account privacy:**  
If your account is private, my application will not be able to extract data and will return a error in the text field on the right.  
You can still use the app without the prefilter (just like in v1.0).   

**What are those icons?**  
The ship contour icons I use here are provided (with approval) by Panzerschiffer from his mod: [Historical Ensigns Contour Icons](https://forum.worldofwarships.com/topic/68159-0702-historical-ensigns-contour-icons/).
